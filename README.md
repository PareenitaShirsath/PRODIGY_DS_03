# 🌳 Task 03 – Decision Tree Classifier | Prodigy Infotech Internship

Hello everyone! 👋  
This is **Task 03** of my Data Science internship with **Prodigy Infotech (June 2025 Batch)**.  
In this project, I built a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features such as job, age, marital status, education, etc.

## 📁 Dataset Used

**Bank Marketing Dataset** from UCI Machine Learning Repository  
🔗 [Dataset Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00222/bank.zip)

File used: `bank.csv`  
- Contains information on 1000+ customers  
- Target column: `y` → whether customer subscribed (`yes` or `no`)

## 🚀 Technologies & Libraries

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy 📊  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 🎨  
- Scikit-learn (sklearn) ⚙️

## 🧠 What I Learned

✅ How to handle real-world data  
✅ What is entropy & how decision trees work  
✅ Data preprocessing and encoding  
✅ Training and testing a ML model  
✅ Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix & classification report

## 🧪 Model Workflow

1. 📥 Load and explore `bank.csv`
2. 🧹 Clean and convert categorical data using `pd.get_dummies()`
3. ✂️ Split data into training and testing sets
4. 🌳 Build a Decision Tree Classifier using `sklearn`
5. 🎯 Evaluate model using:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
